Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable machines to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions. It relies on patterns and inference instead. Machine learning is divided into several types, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, while unsupervised learning involves training on unlabeled data. Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to take actions in an environment to maximize a reward. Machine learning has numerous applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.
